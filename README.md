# Prog2_Hospital_Project

Main purpose of the project was to learn modularity, the importance of 
using different Classes and to further use different data-structures.

Project modelled a hospital with a command-line interface to give and 
fetch different types of data. Project also included a variety of 
different data-structures to ensure the ease of different functions.
